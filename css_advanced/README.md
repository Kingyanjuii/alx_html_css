# Smile School - CSS Advanced Project

Welcome to the Smile School project, part of the ALX Front-End Curriculum!

## Project Objectives

This project builds on the **HTML Advanced** project and focuses on **styling** using **CSS**.  
We are provided with a **Figma design** to recreate a visually appealing and responsive web page using:

- Flexbox layout
- CSS styling techniques
- Fonts, colors, and spacing from the Figma design

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file based on the advanced structure
- `images/`: Folder with all assets (logos, icons, avatars)
- `styles.css`: Will contain custom CSS styling (in later tasks)
- `README.md`: This file!

## Key Skills Practiced

- Writing clean, semantic HTML
- Structuring a multi-section web page
- Preparing for responsive design
- Using developer tools (like Figma) to match visual styles

## Tools & Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (to be added)
- Font Awesome (for social icons)
- Figma (for design reference)
